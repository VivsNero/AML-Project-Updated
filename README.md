# AML-Project

Before running anything nstall the libraries in the requirements .txt file

The project files are parted into several folders, out of them the 'Finished' Folder contains the finished program and its files. The 'Test' folder contains the trainign code for the model/s. The Webcam_test folder contains the files which find and connect a webcam to the facial expression analysis. The spotifyIntegrations contains the spotify integration files without the facial expression analysis or webcam modules.

Within the main folder you can also find the DavidRunningTheCode webm file, which is a video of David running the finished code.

## Running the Finished Code

Install the requirements!
make sure you have a working webcam plugge din, it will not run without it!
you need to have a spotify account

In the 'Finished' folder:
* run the RunProgramMain.py file
* open a http://localhost:8080 window
* login to, and authenticate towards, spotify
* If the code gets stuck after this: click Ctrl-C in the running terminal window, then reload the localhost window (I don't know why it sometimes gets stuck, thi susually fixes it)
* make faces at your webcam 

OBS! the authentication process is a bit wonky, if you are having other issues you can contact me at davidskiold96@gmail.com
